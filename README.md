# user_management
 This User Management App allows users to fetch, search, and manage a list of users efficiently. It integrates GetX for state management and uses debounced search to optimize filtering. Users are fetched from an API, and each user is displayed with a dynamically generated avatar. The app provides a smooth and responsive experience with real-time search functionality.
